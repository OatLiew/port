		        	I tried to take a different approach by implementing Angular JS instead of  regular Jquery and AJAX.  Angular Js is based on the MVC model and uses the concept of two ways binding. 
					As a result, the code looks much cleaner and easier to understand compared to Jquery. 
				</p>

				<p>

	The searching is done through using ng-model and ng-repeat in Angular JS. Ng-repeat is very convenient tool for looping through the JSON file and splitting out the objects without having to write redundant code.  Also, ng-repeat has a sorting library such as orderBy which can be used to order the search result.  
</p> <p>
	In the beginning, I have done the searching by using the SQL query every time the user click the button search. The keyword that is entered will be use in the SQL query (like=”%keyword%”).   I found that the code is much more complicated compared to Jquery and I didn't utilize the full functionality of Angular JS of two way binding. After discovering the ng-repeat, the code was much simpler.
</p>
<p>
	I used mysqlworkBench to import in all the csv file into the AWS RDS. Create the raw table then load the raw information into the table. Then I created another new table then imported the useful datas into the new table. 
</p>

<p>
	When the page is loaded the http request is called to load all the data from RDS and then it is converted to JSON file using JSON_ENCODE. I took me a while to find the information on the onload page in Angular JS.
</p>	
	By importing all the files in SRV/www/htdocs, I was able to view the website on AWSEC2.
<p>
In conclusion, although it took a while to learn and understand Angular JS, MVC and two way bidding, I think the code look much cleaner compared to Jqeury with much more powerful library such as ng-repeat and ng-model, ng-animate...  However, I think it's less flexible and harder to modify the Angular JS compared to the Jquery.
